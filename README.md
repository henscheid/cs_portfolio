## Ian's personal website!
This project is a personal portfolio website I created from scratch using the ReactJS framework.

The website contains a little background info about me, my computer science skills, projects I
have been a part of, my past experiences and how they have shaped me, and a contact form.

Working on this project helped me further my front-end development skills especially in the 
ReactJS framework. I also learned a great deal about website design and functionality.
